# IPL_AUCTION_TEAM_BUILDING
This is an assignment on IPL_AUCTION for building a team of best 40 players from a list of around 650 players

"IPL started with 8 playing teams in one session later on they added 2 more teams and become 10 playing teams league. After 2 sessions with 10 teams, IPL management decide to drop the newly added team they started supporting only 8 teams. Now in a very recent session, they again added 2 two teams.
For our analysis, let's consider IPL will add 2 more teams and will become 12 playing team league. In this scenario, our organisation got a successful bid for one team franchise and our Board needs a list of (sum of) 40 players  in the below categories  so they can go for auctions

# 1.	Batter
# 2.	Bowler
# 3.	Batting all-rounder 
# 4.	Bowling all-rounder 
# 5.	Wickets keepers 
# 6.	Wicket-keeper batter

We have provided the data last 10 IPL Sessions which includes match summary and Ball-to-Ball deliveries data
